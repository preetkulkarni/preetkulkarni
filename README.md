## 💡 About Me

I’m a third-year Computer Science undergraduate at Manipal University Jaipur, with a strong foundation in **software development, networking, and system security architecture**. I’m passionate about building **scalable, secure systems** that solve real-world problems and streamline digital workflows.

As the **Student Director at the Software Development Centre (SDC)** — the university’s in-house tech initiative — I lead a 100+ member team of developers, managing real-time projects, collaborating with faculty stakeholders, and driving engineering best practices across the board.

Currently, I’m exploring **AI and LLM use cases** for productivity, automation, and knowledge systems. I’m actively learning **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and related tools to better understand **multi-agent systems**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** pipelines, and practical AI app deployment.
